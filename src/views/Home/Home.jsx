            Syllogisms are logical arguments that arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions. Syllogisms with more than two propositions are known as polysyllogisms.

            Soak Up Syllogisms is a tool to help you get familiar with Aristotelian syllogisms and polysyllogisms. Five different types of exercises are available to help you understand the concepts more clearly. You can see the exercises by clicking the burger icon; you can practice them or if you are feeling confident, you can go to the quiz section to test yourself.

          <Typography variant="body2">
            If syllogisms are completely new to you then you should read the tutorial before proceeding onto the exercises. In the tutorial you will find explanations on the anatomy of a syllogism and how to represent and manipulate them using venn diagrams. Elliptic venn diagrams are required to solve problems involving polysyllogisms; an explanation of elliptic venn diagrams is also provided.

            The web app also provides the instant solver where you can check your answers to the exercises or an exam question. Please try to solve questions before using the Instant Solver! To understand concepts you must spend time reasoning to derive the correct answer rather than merely using the instant solver.
